# :police_car: The Mobile Incident Reporter (MIR)

When you work in a big organisation, incidents happen. A splash here...a breakage there...
a missing object everywhere. That's nothing unusual.

Recording and reporting what happens usually involves a form to fill in, but wouldn't it 
be handy to be able to use a mobile device to record that? Then, you could log where it 
happened and categorise it before it was sent through the ether to those people that 
receive such reports. 

Welcome to MIR.
