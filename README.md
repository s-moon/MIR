# :police_car: The Mobile Incident Reporter (MIR)

When you work in a big organisation, incidents happen. A splash here...a breakage there...a missing object everywhere. Recording
and reporting what happens usually involves a form to fill in, but wouldn't it be handy to be able to use a mobile device
to take a picture of the incident, log where it happened and categorise it before it was sent through the ether to those
people that receive such reports. MIR...step on stage.
